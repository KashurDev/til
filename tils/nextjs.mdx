## Setup

The recommended way is by creating a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```javascript
const a = '123';
```

After the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the development server. Try editing `pages/index.js` and see the result on your browser.
